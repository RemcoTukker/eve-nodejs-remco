USAGE

	download
	npm install
	node testLife/server

	This will run a game of life of which the starting parameters and setup of eve is done in tests/server and which uses the agents in the agents folder. Included services are a local transport and a http transport (which is rather slow). Codebase is small and should be easy to digest.
