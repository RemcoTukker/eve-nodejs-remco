TODO:

stuff to think about:
when agent is removed, what happens with already scheduled callbacks?
Is knowledge about using JSON RPC going to reside only with the agent or only with the server? Discuss with Ludo
Should it be possible for an agent to behave differently depending on the transport layer used?

functionality: make everything work again

Stability: introduce an onerror for uncaught exceptions (for integrity of files, etc), add typechecking everywhere it could go wrong

style and maintainability:
prettier comments and function descriptions
let somebody look at this code that knows JS better...
add a layer of abstraction to the services to make it easier to write a service (just like agents)

related work:
eve frontend to use eve in an express server and couple UIs to agents (think about security here at some point)
 (server frontend should be a service I guess, agent UIs should be external to Eve)
build browser-side agent environment

security (all optional):
protect agents from each other (eavesdropping) (quite easy, as we have events for each new listener)
protect agents from server (man in the middle) (requires encryption I guess; PGP?)
protect server from agents (taking processor power, changing settings, doing all kind of stuff @ require(agent), ... ) (requires special agent implementation; see my threaded agent code)
see if we want to add some sort of authentication model (PGP?)

optimization:
move stuff down to c++ ? (Peet?)
improve data store, perhaps a db?
